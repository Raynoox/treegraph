# Tree visualization

## user guide:
you can manipulate nodes in any way that doesnt break the rules of Tree (graph has no cycles and is 
connected (path between every node)),

### available options (right-click node):
	* remove - removes node, transfering all children to its parent
	* update value - updates value on the node (user has to click "save" apply changes to server)
	* change parent - change parent
	* add node - adds new node to selected node
#### Leaf - contains sum of all values from root to this leaf
